          <p class="about_information_text">Tasty Bites, nestled in the heart of Durrington, is a vibrant
             Cuban restaurant that brings the rich flavors of Havana to your doorstep. Founded in 1985 by
              Maria Fernandez, a passionate chef from Havana, Tasty Bites began as a small food stall. Maria's
               dream was to share her grandmother's secret recipes with the world. Over the years, the
                stall grew into a beloved local eatery. Known for its authentic Cuban sandwiches, ropa vieja,
                 and refreshing mojitos, Tasty Bites offers a cozy, lively atmosphere. With its colorful
                  decor and live Cuban music nights, it's a little slice of Cuba in Durrington.</p>

          <h3 class="sub_title">Flourishment<font color="#8B0000"><span>.</span></font></h3>
          <p class="about_information_text">In the early 1990s, Tasty Bites expanded under Maria’s visionary
             leadership. She introduced traditional Cuban dance nights, creating a cultural hub for both locals
              and visitors. Maria’s son, Javier, joined the family business in 2000, bringing modern twists
               to classic dishes while preserving the restaurant's authentic roots. They began sourcing
                ingredients directly from Cuba, ensuring the freshest and most genuine flavors. The restaurant's
                 reputation soared, and it became a staple in Durrington’s dining scene. Today, Tasty Bites
                  is celebrated not just for its delectable cuisine but also for its role in fostering
                   community and celebrating Cuban heritage.</p>

          <p class="about_information_text">Today, Tasty Bites stands as a testament to Maria and Javier’s culinary
             passion and dedication. The restaurant has embraced modern technology, offering online reservations
              and a delivery service to cater to the evolving needs of its patrons. Their menu now features innovative
               fusion dishes, blending Cuban flavors with contemporary culinary trends, delighting both traditionalists
                and adventurous foodies. The vibrant decor has been refreshed with local artwork, and the live music
                 events have expanded to include salsa dancing lessons and cultural workshops. Tasty Bites continues
                  to thrive as a beloved Durrington landmark, offering a warm, inviting space where the spirit of Cuba
